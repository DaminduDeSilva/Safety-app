// Simple manual test guide for the Fake Call feature
// Run this to verify that the implementation works as expected

/*
MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST FOR FAKE CALL FEATURE:

1. HOME SCREEN INTEGRATION:
   ✓ Navigate to Home Screen
   ✓ Verify "Quick Call" and "Call Settings" action cards are visible
   ✓ Verify green "Quick Call" floating action button is present
   ✓ Tap Quick Call button - should show confirmation dialog
   ✓ Confirm dialog - should schedule fake call with countdown snackbar
   ✓ Wait for countdown - should trigger fake call screen

2. FAKE CALL SCREEN:
   ✓ Screen should appear full-screen with realistic call interface
   ✓ Caller name and phone number should be displayed
   ✓ Avatar should be generated (colored circle with first letter)
   ✓ Screen should vibrate (if device supports vibration)
   ✓ Ringtone should play (system ringtone or fallback to haptic)
   ✓ Accept button (green) should "answer" the call
   ✓ Decline button (red) should end the call
   ✓ When answered, tap anywhere should end the call
   ✓ Auto-answer after 30 seconds for realism

3. CONFIGURATION SCREEN:
   ✓ Tap "Call Settings" from home screen
   ✓ Form should allow entering caller name and phone number
   ✓ Delay slider should work (3-60 seconds)
   ✓ Save button should store configuration
   ✓ Templates section should show predefined options
   ✓ Tapping template should populate form
   ✓ Saved configurations should appear in list
   ✓ Test button should trigger immediate fake call
   ✓ Edit/Delete options should work

4. ERROR HANDLING:
   ✓ Empty form should show validation errors
   ✓ Network issues should show appropriate messages
   ✓ Permission denials should gracefully fallback
   ✓ Multiple rapid taps should be handled correctly

5. PERMISSIONS & COMPATIBILITY:
   ✓ Audio permission should be requested if needed
   ✓ Vibration permission should be requested if needed
   ✓ Should work on devices without vibration
   ✓ Should work on devices without audio

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Fake calls should look and feel like real incoming calls
- Audio and vibration should be realistic
- User should be able to quickly trigger emergency fake calls
- Configuration should persist across app restarts
- No interference with real phone functionality

TO TEST:
1. Run: flutter run
2. Navigate through the app
3. Follow the checklist above
4. Report any issues found

COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR:
- Audio permissions not granted
- Vibration not working on emulator
- Firebase authentication required for config saving
- Network connectivity for Firestore operations
